# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a responsive sandbox-style voxel game built with TypeScript and Babylon.js. The game enables players to explore a procedurally generated 3D world, place and remove blocks of various types, and interact with the environment using keyboard/mouse controls on desktop or touch controls on mobile devices. The system is designed with future multiplayer capabilities in mind.

## Glossary

- **Voxel Game**: A game where the environment is represented as a 3D grid of cubic blocks (voxels)
- **Block**: A single cubic unit in the game world that can be placed or removed by the player
- **Crosshairs**: A visual indicator (plus-shaped) showing where the player can interact with blocks
- **Player**: The user-controlled entity that can move through and interact with the game world
- **World Generator**: The system component responsible for creating the initial game terrain
- **Game Menu**: The user interface displayed at game start and when paused
- **Block Palette**: The collection of available block types that players can place
- **Joystick**: Touch-based directional control interface for mobile devices
- **Raycast**: A technique to detect which block the player is looking at
- **Rendering Distance**: The maximum distance from the Player at which Blocks are rendered
- **Instanced Mesh**: A rendering optimization technique that reuses geometry data for multiple identical objects
- **Greedy Meshing**: An optimization algorithm that combines adjacent identical blocks into larger meshes to reduce draw calls

5. THE Voxel Game SHALL display a visual indicator showing the currently selected Block type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to start the game by falling from the sky into a pre-generated world, so that I have an engaging entry experience and can begin playing immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Player starts a new game, THE Voxel Game SHALL spawn the Player at a position above the World Generator terrain
2. WHEN the Player spawns, THE Voxel Game SHALL apply gravity to make the Player fall toward the terrain
3. WHEN the Player lands on the terrain, THE Voxel Game SHALL enable full movement and interaction controls
4. THE Voxel Game SHALL generate the initial world before the Player spawns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to explore a diverse starting world with natural features, so that the game environment feels interesting and varied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Voxel Game SHALL generate a starting world containing grass Block terrain as the base layer
2. THE Voxel Game SHALL generate trees composed of wood and leaf Blocks distributed across the terrain

6. THE World Generator SHALL support loading pre-generated world configurations as an alternative to procedural generation
7. THE World Generator SHALL ensure that solid terrain Blocks exist beneath every position where the Player can move
8. WHEN the Player removes a Block, IF removing that Block would create a void with no terrain beneath, THEN THE Voxel Game SHALL prevent the removal operation
