# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a polished, retro-style loading screen for the Minecraft clone game. The system must handle two distinct phases: asset loading (fonts, images) and server connection/authentication. The focus is on controlling visibility of existing UI elements at the correct times and designing new retro-style loading components (loading screen and loading bar) that match the game's Minecraft aesthetic. Existing menu styling will be preserved.

## Glossary

- **Game Client**: The browser-based Three.js application that renders the game
- **Asset Loading Phase**: The initial phase where static assets (images, fonts) are loaded from the file system
- **Connection Phase**: The phase where the Game Client connects to the Game Server via `/api/connect` endpoint
- **Loading Screen**: The visual interface displayed to users while assets load and connection is established
- **Menu Screen**: The main menu interface with Play, Settings, and Guide buttons
- **Retro Style**: Visual design matching Minecraft's pixelated aesthetic with bordered buttons and classic color schemes
- **Loading Bar**: A horizontal progress indicator showing connection status

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a retro-style loading screen while game assets load, so that I know the game is initializing and not frozen

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Game Client starts, THE Game Client SHALL display a new retro-style loading screen overlay
2. WHILE assets are loading (menu2.png, title5.png, press.ttf), THE Game Client SHALL keep the loading screen visible
3. WHEN all required assets are loaded, THE Game Client SHALL hide the loading screen and show the menu background and title
4. THE loading screen SHALL feature a retro visual design with pixelated borders and Minecraft-style colors
5. THE loading screen SHALL display an animated loading indicator (e.g., rotating blocks or dots)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a retro-style loading bar while the game connects to the server, so that I understand connection is in progress

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are loaded, THE Game Client SHALL show the menu background and title image
2. WHILE the `/api/connect` request is pending, THE Game Client SHALL display a retro-style loading bar instead of the Play, Settings, and Guide buttons
3. THE loading bar SHALL be 200 pixels wide to match the button width
4. THE loading bar SHALL use retro styling with pixelated borders matching the existing button aesthetic (2px borders with light/dark edges)
5. THE loading bar SHALL display an animated progress indicator or pulsing effect

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see an error message if the server connection fails, so that I know what went wrong and can try again

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/api/connect` request fails with a network error, THE Game Client SHALL display a retro-style modal with the message "Could not connect to the game server. Try again."
2. THE error modal SHALL use retro styling consistent with game aesthetics
3. THE error modal SHALL include a retry button or mechanism to attempt reconnection
4. THE error modal SHALL remain visible until the user takes action
5. THE error modal SHALL overlay the menu screen

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see an error message if I'm not logged in, so that I understand I need to authenticate before playing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/api/connect` response succeeds but does not include a username field, THE Game Client SHALL display a retro-style modal with the message "Please log in to play"
2. THE authentication error modal SHALL use retro styling consistent with game aesthetics
3. THE authentication error modal SHALL remain visible until the user takes action
4. THE authentication error modal SHALL overlay the menu screen
5. THE authentication error modal SHALL prevent access to game functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the menu buttons only after successful connection, so that I don't try to start the game before it's ready

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/api/connect` request is pending, THE Game Client SHALL hide the Play, Settings, and Guide buttons
2. WHEN the `/api/connect` response succeeds and includes a username, THE Game Client SHALL hide the loading bar and display the Play, Settings, and Guide buttons
3. THE transition from loading bar to buttons SHALL replace the loading bar element with the button elements
4. THE existing button styles SHALL remain unchanged
5. THE Game Client SHALL not allow game start until connection is established and buttons are visible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the loading screen implementation to be maintainable, so that future updates are easy to implement

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE loading screen logic SHALL be separated into distinct phases (asset loading, connection, error handling)
2. THE new loading screen and loading bar styles SHALL follow existing CSS patterns (borders, colors, box-shadows)
3. THE error modals SHALL reuse existing modal styling patterns from the codebase
4. THE loading screen code SHALL include clear comments explaining each phase
5. THE implementation SHALL preserve all existing menu styles without modification
